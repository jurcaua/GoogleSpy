## GoogleSpy
### The guy in the van never really got much credit.

Take control of your fellow spy, sending him all the instructions he needs to complete the mission.

_Powered by Google Home & Unity._

## Inspriation
Wanted to break the usual misrepresentation of sidekicks. They sometimes do more work than the big guys.
Shout-out to Wade from Kim Possible. Keep doing your thing.

## What it does
Uses Google Assistant to analyze user queries and transpose them into in-game actions in Unity. 

## How we built it
Firebase database of most recent Google Assistant query results that we pull into Unity and parse. 

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up and working with the Actions with Google console + database, and finding a way to connect to Unity (which is not supported out-the-box).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Character design, truly encapsulating the personality of the Google Assistant.
And I guess the third-party integration with Unity is pretty cool too. Yea that too.

## What we learned
Better teamwork and splitting tasks efficiently. How trust is crucial to the team dynamic.

## What's next for Google Spy
Expanding to concurrent users, more levels, more commands, and much more love for Wade in Kim Possible.
